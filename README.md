# NWLottoSystem

A program related to South Africa national lotto system. The app will attempt to view past lotto results and attempt to generate statistically best lotto numbers.

I'm going to be vague about the spesifics, but one can easily enough view the stats involved in the code. Nothing fancy was done in the app, bear bone app written in a day.

So far I've managed to break even. Should you attempt to use it, contact me about the URL needed. Requires a postgres database and few tables. Also requires telegram to request lotto numbers.
